# Exercise 02 - HTML and CSS 

## Student Description

**Name:** Eunel Jacob C. Joyosa

**Degree Program:** BS Computer Science

**Section:** C-1L

## Key Takeaways from the Exercise
This exercise was very tricky at first since it's been so long since I created a webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS. But after creating my static webpage for the exercise, it reinforced and actually expanded my knowledge in writing HTML/CSS on designing a webpage. It also strengthened my skill in version control by integrating the use of git and GitHub on doing the exercise which makes managing my files easier and more efficient.
