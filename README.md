# Exercise 03 - JavaScript Basics 1

## Student Description

**Name:** Eunel Jacob C. Joyosa

**Degree Program:** BS Computer Science

**Section:** C-1L

## Things you did in your code
I have implemented a total of three functions, as the specifications have told namely: validatePWord(), flipThePWord(), and storePWord().

### **validatePWord()**
- Firstly, it checks if the two strings if they match together, compared by === operator.
- Then, it checks for the password length (minimum char is 8).
- Uses For Loops and the Initialized Character Arrays of Uppercase, Lowercase and Number Arrays to check whether the string comprises at least one of each.

### **flipThePWord()**
- Initialized a new string that is the concatenated version of the given password to itself, in order to generate flipped version.
- Initialized an empty string to append the flipped string.
- Used a for loop that starts from the very end of the string towards the beginning and will append to the empty string.

### **storePWord()**
- Initialized an object named user
- Appends the given name onto the key named 'name'.
- If-else statements that will determine what the newpassword value would be depending on the cases: If valid, return the flipped version. Otherwise, return the first password given.

## Key Takeaways from the Exercise
By doing this exercise, it helped me well on recalling most of what I did during the CMSC 12 JavaScript exercise. From that, the handout and some additional references I went to, it helped a ton on doing the exercise in order for me to finish the exercise and get the correct expected output. It was quite tricky at first, but as the hour went by, my approach got more clear.
